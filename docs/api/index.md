# API
This plugin/addon to SVG is not planning (currently) to have a large API. Instead, developers will be expected to connect over websocket to the server, via the server's configured address.

This is due to the fact I built this as a websocket-based plugin, where anyone with the correct password/information can connect with any client to the websocket.

## Core
- You can build your own implementation of SimpleVoice-Geyser for a platform using the new Core Module.
- See the [Core Module](https://github.com/TheodoreMeyer/SimpleVoice-Geyser/tree/master/core) for more information.
- Download any jar with Core in it at [Releases](https://github.com/TheodoreMeyer/SimpleVoice-Geyser/releases).

## Websocket
- In Progress...
### Protocol
- Svg follows a protocol for server ↔ client communication.
- This can be found at [Protocol]({% project_link api/protocol %}).
- Android/Svg-App client awareness is documented at [Android Awareness](https://theodoremeyer.github.io/projects/simplevoicegeyser/0.1.3/android-awareness/).

### To Be added
- Connection types, so server admins can limit how you can connect.
- More Websocket support for diverse client types (whether an app, or an HTML page that is in the server website itself, etc. myserver.com/svg).

# Notes:
- Feel free to come and give feedback or even contribute to this. I am open to ideas.
